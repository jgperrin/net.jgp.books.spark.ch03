# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 3

Welcome to Spark in Action, 2nd edition, chapter 3. This chapter is all about the dataframe, understand its role and royalty!

This code is designed to work with Apache Spark v3.0.0.

## Labs

### Lab \#200

`IngestionSchemaManipulationApp`: ingestion of a CSV, manipulation of schema structure post-ingestion

## Running the labs

### Running the labs in Java

For information on running the Java lab, see chapter 3 in [Spark in Action, 2nd edition](http://jgp.net/sia).


### Running the labs using PySpark

You will need:
 * `git`.
 * Apache Spark (please refer Appendix P - 'Spark in production: installation and a few tips').

1. Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch03

2. Go to the lab in the Python directory

Here, we show lab #200.

    cd net.jgp.books.spark.ch03/src/main/python/lab200_ingestion_schema_manipulation/

3. Execute the following spark-submit command to create a jar file to our this application

    spark-submit ingestionSchemaManipulationApp.py

### Running the lab in Scala

You will need:

 * `git`.
 * Apache Spark (please refer Appendix P - 'Spark in production: installation and a few tips'). 

1. Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch03

2. Go to the directory

    cd net.jgp.books.spark.ch03

3. Package application using sbt command

    sbt clean assembly

4. Run Spark/Scala application using spark-submit command as shown below:

    spark-submit --class net.jgp.books.spark.ch03.lab200_ingestion_schema_manipulation.IngestionSchemaManipulationScalaApp target/scala-2.12/SparkInAction2-Chapter03-assembly-1.0.0.jar

## Notes: 
 1. [Java] Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10 (published in April 2019).
 2. [Scala, Python] As of MEAP v14, we have introduced Scala and Python examples (published in October 2019).
